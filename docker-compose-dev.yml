#Use this compose file to run both the vertx web server and
#Take advantage having a browersync server to watch and automagically
#compile and update your files. Note: sometimes when it detects a change,
#the typescript files are not recompiled into the respective js mappings (eg run "npm run compile" which
#runs the node task compile specified in the package.json (: )
